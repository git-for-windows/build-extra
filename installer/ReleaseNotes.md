# Git for Windows v2.7.2 Release Notes
Latest update: February 23rd 2016

## Introduction

These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release. The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found [in the Git project](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes).

See [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/) for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at [https://git-for-windows.github.io/](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

# Known issues
* Special permissions (and Windows Vista or later) are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use `git clone -c core.symlinks=true <URL>` to enable it, see details [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links).
* If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) first and accept the host key.
* Some console programs interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through `winpty` (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as `winpty python` instead of just `python`).
* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se) uses `$HOME/_netrc` instead of `$HOME/.netrc`.
* If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. "`/usr/bin/bash.exe`" to "`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe`". When that is not desired -- e.g. "`--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack`" or "`-L/regex/`" -- you need to set the environment variable `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` temporarily, like so:

  > `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc`

  Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion.
* Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as `mydocu~1.txt`. A workaround is to call `git config core.protectNTFS false`, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).
* Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting `core.longPaths`, e.g. `git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...`.
*   Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.
*   As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, all Git commands requiring Python are not yet supported; e.g. `git p4`.
*   The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.

Should you encounter other problems, please search [the bug tracker](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues) and [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows), chances are that the problem was reported already. If it has not been reported, please follow [our bug reporting guidelines](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Issue-reporting-guidelines) and [report the bug](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/new).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.7.1(2) (February 12th 2016)

### New Features

* Git for Windows' SDK version 1.0.2 [has been released](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/releases/tag/git-sdk-1.0.2).
* The "list references" window of `gitk` [is now wider by default](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/620).
* Comes with [Git 2.7.2](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2158401).

### Bug Fixes

* The user is [now presented with a nice error message](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/527) when calling `node` while `node.exe` is not in the `PATH` (this bug also affected other interactive console programs such as `python` and `php`).
* The arrow keys [are respected again in gitk](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/495).
* When a too-long path is encountered, `git clean -dfx` [no longer aborts quietly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/521).
* Git GUI learned to [stage lines appended to a single-line file](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/515).
* When launching `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash -l -i` in a cmd window and pressing Ctrl+C, [the console is no longer corrupted](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/205) (previously, the `bash.exe` redirector would terminate and both cmd & Bash would compete for user input).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.7.1 (February 6th 2016)

### New Features

* The context menu items in the explorer [now show icons](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/97).

### Bug Fixes

* A bug [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/4abc31070f683e555de95331da0990052f55caa5) where worktrees would forget their location e.g. after an interactive rebase.
* Thanks to Eric Lawrence and Martijn Laan, [our installer sports a better way to look for system files now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/tree/master/installer/InnoSetup).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.7.0(2) (February 2nd 2016)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git 2.7.1](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/285657).

### Bug Fixes

* Git GUI now [starts properly even when the working directory contains non-ASCII characters](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/410).
* We forgot to enable Address Space Layout Randomization and Data Execution Prevention on our Git wrapper, and this is [now fixed](//github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/644).
* A bug in one of the DLLs used by Git for Windows [was fixed](https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/pull/1051) that prevented Git from working properly in 64-bit setups where [the `FLG_LDR_TOP_DOWN` global flag](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc779664%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) is set.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.7.0 (January 5th 2016)

### New Features

* To stave off exploits, Git for Windows [now uses Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP)](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/612).
* Git for Windows' support for `git pull --rebase=interactive` that was dropped when the `pull` command was rewritten in C, [was resurrected](https://github.com/git/git/commit/f9219c0b3).
* The installers are now [dual signed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/592) with SHA-2 and SHA-1 certificates.
* The uninstaller [is signed now, too](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/540).

### Bug Fixes

* When installing as administrator, we [no longer offer the option to install quiicklaunch icons](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/commit/a13ffd7c3fa24e2ac1ef3561d7a7f09a0b924338) because quicklaunch icons can only be installed per-user.
* If a `~/.bashrc` is detected without a `~/.bash_profile`, the generated file will now [also source `~/.profile` if that exists](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/91).
* The environment variable `HOME` can now be used to set the home directory [even when running with accounts that are part of a different domain than the current (non-domain-joined) machine](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/9660c5ffe82b921dd2193efa18e9721f47a6b22f) (in which case the MSYS2 runtime has no way to emulate POSIX-style UIDs).
* Git [can now fetch and push via HTTPS](https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/pull/986) even when the `http.sslCAInfo` config variable was unset.
* Git for Windows is now [handling the case gracefully where the current user has no permission to list the parent of the current directory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/606).
* More file locking issues ("Unlink of file ... failed. Should I try again?") [were fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/500).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.6.4 (December 14th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.7.0](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2118402).

## Bug Fixes

* Non-ASCII command-lines are now [passed properly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/4c362726c41102173613658) to shell scripts.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.6.3 (November 10th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.6.4](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2103498).
* Also available as `.tar.bz2` packages (you need an MSYS2/Cygwin-compatible unpacker to recreate the symbolic links correctly).

## Bug Fixes

* Git for Windows v2.6.3's installer [failed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/523) to [elevate privileges automatically](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/526) (reported [three times](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/528), making it a charm), and as a consequence Git for Windows 2.6.3 was frequently [installed per-user by mistake](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/commit/23672af723da18e5bc3c679e52106de3c2dec55a)
* The bug where [`SHELL_PATH` had spaces](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/542) and that was [reported](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/498) multiple [times](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/468) has been [fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/7f4284d245f9c736dc8ec52e12c5d67cea7e4ba9).
* An additional work-around from upstream Git for `SHELL_PATH` containing spaces (fixing [problems with interactive rebase's `exec` command](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/542) has been applied.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.6.2 (October 19th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.6.3](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/280947).
* [Enables the stack smasher to protect against buffer overflows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/501).

### Bug Fixes

* Git Bash [works now even when choosing Windows' default console *and* installing into a short path (e.g. `C:\Git`)](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/509).
* Notepad [can now really be used to edit commit messages](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/517).
* Git's garbage collector [now handles stale `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` gracefully](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/423).
* The regression in Git for Windows 2.6.2 that it required administrator privileges to be installed [is now fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/86).
* When `notepad` is configured as default editor, we no longer do anything specially [unless editing files inside `.git/`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/488).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.6.1 (October 5th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git v2.6.2
* Users who are part of a Windows domain [now have sensible default values](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/487) for `user.name` and `user.email`.

### Bug Fixes

* We [no longer run out of page file space](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/486) when `git fetch`ing large repositories.
* The description of Windows' default console is accurate now (the console became more powerful in Windows 10).
* *Git GUI* now respects the [terminal emulation chosen at install time](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/490) when [running the *Git Bash*](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/492).

## Changes since Git-2.6.0 (September 29th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.6.1
* The installer [now writes the file `/etc/install-options.txt`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/454) to record which options were chosen at install time.
* Replaces `git flow` with [the *AVH edition*](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) which is maintained actively, in surprising and disappointing contrast to Vincent Driessen's very own project.

### Bug Fixes

* The `PATH` variable [is now really left alone](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/438) when choosing the *"Use Git from Git Bash only"* option in the installer. Note that upgrading Git for Windows will call the previous version's uninstaller, which might still have that bug.
* Git GUI's *Registry>Create Desktop Icon* [now generates correct shortcuts](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/448).
* The `antiword` utility to render Word documents for use in `git diff` [now works correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/453).
* In 64-bit installations, we [no longer set a pack size limit by default](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/288).
* When installing Git for Windows as regular user, [the installer no longer tries to create privileged registry keys](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/455).

## Changes since Git-2.5.3 (September 18th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.6.0
* The `WhoUses.exe` tool to determine which process holds a lock on a given file (which was shipped with Git for Windows 1.x) [gets installed alongside Git for Windows again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/408).
* The values `CurrentVersion`, `InstallPath` and `LibexecPath` are [added to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GitForWindows` registry key](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/427) to help third-party add-ons to find us.
* When fetching or pushing with Git *without* a console, we now [fall back to Git GUI's `askpass` helper](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/428) to ask for pass phrases.
* When run through `<INSTALL_PATH>\cmd\git.exe`, Git [will find tools in `$HOME/bin`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/429) now.

### Bug Fixes

* The portable version avoids DLL search path problems [even when installed into a FAT filesystem](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/390).
* Configuring `notepad` as editor without configuring a width for commit messages [no longer triggers an error message](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/430).
* When using Windows' default console for *Git Bash*, [the `.sh` file associations work again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/396).
* Portable Git's `README` [is now clearer about the need to run `post-install.bat` when unpacking manually](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/83).
* [We use the `winpty` trick now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/436) to run `ipython` interactively, too.
* When the environment variable `HOME` is not set, we [now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/414) fall back [correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/434) to use `HOMEDRIVE` and `HOMEPATH`.
* The home directory is now [set correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/435) when running as the `SYSTEM` user.
* The environment variable `GIT_WORK_TREE` [may now differ in lower/upper case with the Git's idea of the current working directory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/402).
* Running `git clone --dissociate ...` [no longer locks the pack files during the repacking phase](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/446).
* Upstream cURL fixes for NTLM proxy issues ("Unknown SSL error") [were backported](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/373).
* The 64-bit version [now includes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/449) the `astextplain` script it lacked by mistake.

## Changes since Git-2.5.2(2) (September 13th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.5.3.
* Includes [`git flow`](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
* By configuring `git config core.editor notepad`, users [can now use `notepad.exe` as their default editor](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/381). Configuring `git config format.commitMessageColumns 72` will be picked up by the notepad wrapper and line-wrap the commit message after the user edited it.
* The Subversion bindings for use with `git svn` [were upgraded to version 1.9.1](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/374).
* Some interactive console programs, e.g. `psql.exe`, [now work in mintty thanks to pre-configured aliases](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/399).
* The mechanism to diff `.pdf`, `.doc` and `.docx` files known from Git for Windows 1.x [has been ported to Git for Windows 2.x](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/355).
* Git can now [access IPv6-only hosts via HTTP/HTTPS](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/370).

### Bug Fixes

* The `.vimrc` in the home directory [is now allowed to have DOS line endings](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/364).
* The `README.portable` file of the portable Git [mentions the need to run `post-install.bat`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/394) when the archive was extracted manually.
* Home directories for user names [with non-ASCII characters](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/331) are [handled](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/336) correctly [now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/383).
* The documentation [no longer shows plain-text `linkgit:...` "links"](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/404) but proper hyperlinks instead.
* The `mtab` link [is written to `/etc/mtab` again, as it should](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/405).
* When run inside the PowerShell, Git no longer gets confused when the current directory's path and what is recorded in the file system differs in case (e.g. "GIT/" vs "Git/").

## Changes since Git-2.5.2 (September 10th 2015)

### Bug Fixes

* The Git GUI [can be launched from the Start menu again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/376).
* It [now works](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/305) to call `git add -p -- .` when there is a large number of files.
* The Arrow keys can be used in the Bash history again [when run in the Windows console](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/353).
* Tab completion in the context of a large Active Directory [is no longer slow](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/377).

## Changes since Git-2.5.1 (August 31th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.5.2
* Alternates [can now point to UNC paths](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/286), i.e. network drives.

### Bug Fixes

* The MSYS2 runtime was taught [not to look hard for groups](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/193), speeding up *Git Bash*'s startup time.
* A [work around](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/361) was added for [issues](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/32-bit-issues) when installing 32-bit Git for Windows on 64-bit Windows 10.
* The installer [no longer freezes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/351) when there are interactive commands in the user's `.profile`.
* `git rebase --skip` [was speeded up again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/365).
* The redirector in `/bin/bash.exe` now adjusts the `PATH` environment variable correctly (i.e. so that Git's executables are found) before launching the *real* Bash, even when called without `--login`.
* When installing Git for Windows to a location whose path is longer than usual, Git commands [no longer trigger occasional `Bad address` errors](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/303).
* Git [no longer asks for a DVD to be inserted again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/329) when one has been ejected from the `D:` drive.

## Changes since Git-2.5.0 (August 18th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.5.1

### Bug Fixes

* Backspace [works now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/282) with ConHost-based (`cmd.exe`) terminal.
* When there is a `~/.bashrc` but no `~/.bash_profile`, [the latter will be created automatically](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/71).
* When calling a non-login shell, [the prompt now works](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/72).
* The text in the installer describing the terminal emulator options [is no longer cut off](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/69).
* The `connect.exe` tool to allow SSH connections via HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxies [is included in Git for Windows again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/73), as it was in Git for Windows 1.x.
* The `LANG` variable is [no longer left unset](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/298) (which caused troubles with vim).
* `call start-ssh-agent` [no longer spits out bogus lines](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/314).
* It is now possible [even behind NTLM-authenticated proxies](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/309) to install [Git for Windows' SDK](https://git-for-windows.github.io/#download-sdk).
* We [can handle the situation now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/318) when the first `$PATH` elements point outside of Git for Windows' `bin/` directories and contain `.dll` files that interfere with our own (e.g. PostgreSQL's `libintl-8.dll`).
* The `patch` tool [is now included again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/74) as it was in Git for Windows 1.x.

## Changes since Git-2.4.6 (July 18th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.5.0
* On Windows 7 and later, [the *Git Bash* can now correctly be pinned to the task bar](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/263).

### Bug Fixes

* The size of the installers [was reduced again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/262), almost to the levels of Git for Windows 1.x.
* Under certain circumstances, when the Windows machine is part of a Windows domain with lots of users, the startup of the *Git Bash* [is now faster](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/193).
* Git [no longer warns about being unable to read bogus Git attributes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/255).

## Changes since Git-2.4.5 (June 29th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.4.6

### Bug Fixes

* Git for Windows handles symlinks now, [even if core.symlinks does not tell Git to generate symlinks itself](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/220).
* `git svn` learned [*not* to reuse incompatible on-disk caches left over from previous Git for Windows versions](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/246).

## Changes since Git-2.4.4 (June 20th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.4.5

### Bug Fixes

* Git Bash [no longer crashes when called with `TERM=msys`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/222). This reinstates compatibility with GitHub for Windows.

## Changes since Git-2.4.3 (June 12th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.4.4
* The POSIX-to-Windows path mangling [can now be turned off](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/pull/11) by setting the `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` environment variable. This even works for individual command lines: `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 cmd /c dir /x` will list the files in the current directory along with their 8.3 versions.

### Bug Fixes

* `git-bash.exe` [no longer changes the working directory to the user's home directory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/130).
* Git [can now clone into a drive root](https://github.com/msysgit/git/issues/359), e.g. `C:\`.
* For backwards-compatibility, redirectors are installed into `/bin/bash.exe` and `/bin/git.exe`, e.g. [to support SourceTree and TortoiseGit better](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/208).
* When using `core.symlinks = true` while cloning repositories with symbolic links pointing to directories, [`git status` no longer shows bogus modifications](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/210).

## Changes since Git-2.4.2 (May 27th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.4.3

### Bug Fixes

* [We include `diff.exe`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/163) just as it was the case in Git for Windows 1.x
* The certificates for accessing remote repositories via HTTPS [are found on XP again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/168).
* `clear.exe` and the cursor keys in vi [work again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/169) when Git Bash is run in Windows' default console window ("ConHost").
* The ACLs of the user's temporary directory are no longer modified when mounting `/tmp/` (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/190).
* *Git Bash Here* works even from the context menu of the empty area in Windows Explorer's view of C:\, D:\, etc (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/176).

## Changes since Git-2.4.1 (May 14th 2015)

### New Features

* On Windows Vista and later, [NTFS junctions can be used to emulate symlinks now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/156); To enable this emulation, the `MSYS` environment variable needs to be set to `winsymlinks:nativestrict`.
* The *Git Bash* learned to support [several options to support running the Bash in arbitrary terminal emulators](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/ac6b03cb4).

* The `ls` command shows non-ASCII filenames correctly now (Issue 188).

* `gitk` tries not to crash when it is closed while reading references (Issue 125, thanks Pat Thoyts).
* In some setups, hard-linking is not as reliable as it should be, so we have a workaround which avoids hard links in some situations (Issues 222 and 229).
* `git-svn` sets `core.autocrlf` to `false` now, hopefully shutting up most of the `git-svn` reports.

* Support `PAGER`s with spaces in their filename.
* Quite a few changes were undone which we needed in the olden days of msysGit.

## Changes since Git-1.5.6-preview20080622

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.5.6.1.

## Changes since Git-1.5.5-preview20080413

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.5.6.
* Installer supports configuring a user provided Plink (PuTTY).

### Bugfixes
* Comes with tweaked `msys-1.0.dll` to solve some command line mangling issues.
* cmd wrapper does no longer close the command window.
* Programs in the system `PATH`, for example editors, can be launched from Git without specifying their full path.
* `git stash apply stash@{1}` works.

## Changes since Git-1.5.4-preview20080202

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.5.5.
* `core.autocrlf` is enabled (`true`) by default. This means git converts to Windows line endings (CRLF) during checkout and converts to Unix line endings (LF) during commit. This is the right choice for cross-platform projects. If the conversion is not reversible, git warns the user. The installer warns about the new default before the installation starts.
* The user does no longer have to "accept" the GPL but only needs to press "continue".
* Installer deletes shell scripts that have been replaced by builtins. Upgrading should be safer.
* Supports `git svn`. Note that the performance might be below your expectation.

### Bugfixes
* Newer ssh fixes connection failures (issue 74).
* Comes with MSys-1.0.11-20071204.  This should solve some "fork: resource unavailable" issues.
* All DLLs are rebased to avoid problems with "fork" on Vista.

## Changes since Git-1.5.3.6-preview20071126

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.5.4.
* Some commands that are not yet suppoted on Windows are no longer included (see Known Issues above).
* Release notes are displayed in separate window.
* Includes `qsort` replacement to improve performance on Windows 2000.

### Bugfixes
* Fixes invalid error message that setup.ini cannot be deleted on uninstall.
* Setup tries harder to finish the installation and reports more detailed errors.
* Vim's syntax highlighting is suitable for dark background.

## Changes since Git-1.5.3.5-preview20071114

### New Features
* Git is included in version 1.5.3.6.
* Setup displays release notes.

### Bugfixes
* `pull`/`fetch`/`push` in `git-gui` works. Note, there is no way for `ssh` to ask for a passphrase or for confirmation if you connect to an unknown host. So, you must have ssh set up to work without passphrase. Either you have a key without passphrase, or you started ssh-agent. You may also consider using PuTTY by pointing `GIT_SSH` to `plink.exe` and handle your ssh keys with Pageant. In this case you should include your login name in urls. You must also connect to an unknown host once from the command line and confirm the host key, before you can use it from `git-gui`.

## Changes since Git-1.5.3-preview20071027

### New Features
