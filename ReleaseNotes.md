# Git for Windows v2.38.1 Release Notes
Latest update: October 18th 2022

## Introduction

These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release. The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found [in the Git project](https://github.com/git/git/tree/HEAD/Documentation/RelNotes).

See [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/) for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/).

# Known issues
* On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use `git clone -c core.symlinks=true <URL>` to enable it, see details [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links).
* If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) first and accept the host key.
* Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through `winpty` (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as `winpty python` instead of just `python`).
* If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. "`/usr/bin/bash.exe`" to "`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe`". When that is not desired -- e.g. "`--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack`" or "`-L/regex/`" -- you need to set the environment variable `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` temporarily, like so:

  > `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc`

  Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. "`//usr/bin/bash.exe`".
* Windows drives are normally recognized within the POSIX path as `/c/path/to/dir/` where `/c/` (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the `C:\` Windows prefix to the `\path\to\dir`. If this is not recognized, revert to the `C:\path\to\dir` Windows style.
* Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as `mydocu~1.txt`. A workaround is to call `git config core.protectNTFS false`, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).
* Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting `core.longPaths`, e.g. `git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...`.
* Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.
* As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, `git p4` (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.
* The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.
* Older versions of the Windows Explorer do *not* calculate Git for Windows' on-disk size correctly, as it is unaware of hard links. Therefore, it might look like Git for Windows takes up 1.5GB when in reality it is about a third of that.
* Git command hints are designed for a POSIX shell, this can lead to issues when using them **as is** in non-POSIX shells like PowerShell, [such as this ticket](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2785).
* When pushing via the `git://` protocol, Git for Windows may hang indefinitely. The last console output in this case is typically `Writing objects: 100%`. Until issue [#907](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/907) is addressed, run this command once as a work-around: `git config sendpack.sideband false`.
* Git for Windows executables linked to `msys-2.0.dll` are not compatible with Mandatory ASLR and may crash if system-wide Mandatory ASLR is enabled in Windows Exploit protection. A workaround is to disable ASLR for all executables in `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`, run in administrator powershell (replace `$_.Name` with `$_` to use full path to executable instead of name):

  > `Get-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\*.exe" | %{ Set-ProcessMitigation -Name $_.Name -Disable ForceRelocateImages }`

  Alternatively, you can disable Mandatory ASLR completely in Windows Exploit protection.

Should you encounter other problems, please first search [the bug tracker](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues) (also look at the closed issues) and [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows), chances are that the problem was reported already. Also make sure that you use an up to date Git for Windows version (or a [current snapshot build](https://wingit.blob.core.windows.net/files/index.html)). If it has not been reported, please follow [our bug reporting guidelines](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Issue-reporting-guidelines) and [report the bug](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/new).

### (Upcoming) breaking changes

We updated the included Bash to version 5.1 (previously 4.4). Please check your shell scripts for potential compatibility issues.

Also, as previously announced, Git for Windows dropped support for Windows Vista.

Around the beginning of 2023, Git for Windows will drop support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8, following [Cygwin's and MSYS2's lead](https://www.msys2.org/docs/windows_support/) (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.37.2](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.37.2/Documentation/RelNotes/2.37.2.txt).

* Comes with [Perl v5.36.0](http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-5.36.0/pod/perldelta.pod).
* Git's executables are [now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/429) marked [Terminal Server-aware](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3942), meaning: Git will be slightly faster when being run using Remote Desktop Services.
* `git svn` is now based on [subversion v1.14.2](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.14.2/CHANGES).
* Comes with [GNU TLS v3.7.7](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2022-July/004746.html).

### Bug Fixes

* Git for Windows [now ships without the `zmore` and `bzmore` utilities](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/430) (which were broken and included only inadvertently).
* A [regression in the `vimdiff` mode of `git mergetool`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3945) has been [fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3960).
* With certain network drives, [it was reported](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3727) that some attributes associated with caching confused Git for Windows. This [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3753).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.37.0 (June 27th 2022)

This release addresses [CVE-2022-31012](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2) and [CVE-2022-29187](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-j342-m5hw-rr3v).

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.37.1](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.37.1/Documentation/RelNotes/2.37.1.txt).

* Comes with [tig v2.5.5](https://github.com/jonas/tig/releases/tag/tig-2.5.5).

### Bug Fixes

* Pasting large amounts of text in Git for Windows' Bash when running inside Windows Terminal [often resulted in garbled text](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3936), which has been fixed.
* The Perl module [perl-Clone](https://metacpan.org/source/ATOOMIC/Clone-0.45/Changes) which linked to a non-existing DLL was rebuilt to fix the issue.
* The Git for Windows installer can no longer be tricked into running an untrusted `git.exe` in elevated mode ([CVE-2022-31012](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2)).
* When running Git in a world-writable directory owned by the current user (think `C:\Windows\Temp`, when running under the `SYSTEM` account), the checks for dubious ownership of the `.git` directory now detect this situation properly ([CVE-2022-29187](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-j342-m5hw-rr3v)).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.36.1 (May 9th 2022)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.37.0](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.37.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.37.0.txt).
* Many anti-malware products seem to have problems with our MSYS2 runtime, leading to problems running e.g. `git subtree`. We [added a workaround](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/pull/37) that hopefully helps in most of these scenarios.
* Comes with MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on [Cygwin 3.3.5](https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin-announce/2022-May/010565.html).

* Comes with [GNU TLS v3.7.6](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2022-May/004744.html).
* SSH's CBC ciphers, which were re-enabled in 2017 to better support Azure Repos [have again been disabled by default](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/421) because Azure Repos does not require them any longer.
* Comes with [OpenSSL v1.1.1p](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html).
* Comes with [Git Credential Manager Core v2.0.779](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/releases/tag/v2.0.779).
* Comes with [cURL v7.84.0](https://curl.haxx.se/changes.html#7_84_0).

* A bug in the interaction between FSCache and parallel checkout [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3909).
* Cloning to network shares failed on some network file systems, which was [fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3646).
* When Git indicates an unsafe directory due to the file system (e.g. FAT32) being unable to record ownership, Git [now gives better hints](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3887).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.36.0 (April 20th 2022)

### Upcoming breaking changes

We plan to update the included bash to version 5.1 (currently 4.4) soon after Git for Windows 2.36.0 is released. Please check your shell scripts for potential compatibility issues.

Git for Windows will also stop supporting Windows Vista soon after Git for Windows 2.36.0 is released. Around the beginning of 2023, Git for Windows will drop support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8, following [Cygwin's and MSYS2's lead](https://www.msys2.org/docs/windows_support/) (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.36.1](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.36.1/Documentation/RelNotes/2.36.1.txt).
* On newer Windows versions, Git [now assumes a Win32 Console with full color capabilities](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3751). This helps e.g. when NeoVIM is configured as Git's editor.
* Comes with [OpenSSH v9.0p1](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.0).
* When `git clean` fails due to long paths, [Git now advises the user to set `core.longPaths`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3817).
* Comes with [cURL v7.83.0](https://curl.haxx.se/changes.html#7_83_0).
* Git Credential Manager's binaries [are no longer installed in the same location as core Git's own dashed programs](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/406). This separates more clearly the core Git executables from the Git executables provided by third-parties.
* Comes with [Git Credential Manager Core v2.0.696](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/releases/tag/v2.0.696).
* Comes with [OpenSSL v1.1.1o](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html).
* Comes with [patch level 4](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/d72d5e8aeb7df99c55bdc438fb71fdeffd2bd1e5) of the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on [Cygwin 3.3.4](https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin-announce/2022-January/010438.html).

### Bug Fixes

* A regression introduced in Git for Windows v2.36.0 where GPG in 32-bit versions simply would not work [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/MSYS2-packages/commit/002b641e4409ce76709419e835e1fb2a6de14e7c).
* The `proxy-lookup` helper [only reported the first letter of the proxy](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3818), which was fixed.
* The installer [now verifies that .NET Framework 4.7.2 is available](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/329) before offering Git Credential Manager (GCM) as an option (because it is required for GCM to work).
* A bug introduced into v2.36.0 where [shell scripts failed to run on some network shares with the error "Too many levels of symbolic links"](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3825) was fixed.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.35.3 (April 15th 2022)

This version includes Git LFS v3.1.4, addressing [CVE-2022-24826](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw3-3whw-jvjj) (if you use Git LFS with [MinGit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/MinGit), you will want to upgrade).

For now, this is opt-in, with the idea of eventually retiring GCM for Windows.
* Comes with [cURL v7.71.1](https://curl.haxx.se/changes.html#7_71_1).
* Comes with [Perl v5.32.0](http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-5.32.0/pod/perldelta.pod).

### Bug Fixes

* A typo [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/291) in the installer.
* The new `git pull` behavior option [now records the `fast-forward` choice correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/292).
* In v2.27.0, [`git svn` was broken completely](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2649), which has been fixed.

* When reinstalling (or upgrading) Git for Windows, [the "Pseudo Console Support" choice is now remembered correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/295).
* Under certain circumstances, the Git Bash window (MinTTY) [would crash frequently](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2687), which has been addressed.
* When pseudo console support is enabled, [the VIM editor sometimes had troubles accepting certain keystrokes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2689), which was fixed.
* Due to a bug, it was not possible to disable Pseudo Console support by reinstalling with the checkbox turned off, [which has been fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/299).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.26.2 (April 20th 2020)

Due to [a bug when handling symbolic links that was fixed in this version](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2637), `git status` will show symbolic links as modified even as `git diff` won't report any changes. The quickest work-around is to call `git add -u` which lets Git realize that nothing changed, actually.

This release comes with a Git Bash that optionally uses [Windows-native pseudo consoles](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/). Meaning: finally, Git Bash can accommodate console programs like `node.exe`, Python or PHP, without using the `winpty` helper (see [_Known Issues_ above](#known-issues)). Note that this is still a very new feature and is therefore known to have some corner-case bugs.

### New Features

* The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) [are now linked in a Start Menu item](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/283).
* Comes with [Git LFS v2.11.0](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v2.11.0).
* Comes with [OpenSSH v8.3p1](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.3).

### Bug Fixes

* Some Perl packages (e.g. `Net::SSLeay`) that [had been broken recently](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2598) have been fixed.
* Git for Windows and WSL Git [now have the same idea of symbolic links' length](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2637), i.e. `git status` will no longer mark them as modified in Git for Windows after checking them out in WSL.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.26.1 (April 9th 2020)

Yet another security fix release: With a crafted URL that contains a newline or empty host, or lacks a scheme, the credential helper machinery can be fooled into providing credential information that is not appropriate for the protocol in use and host being contacted (CVE-2020-11008).

### Bug Fixes

* The shell construct `<(<command>)`, which was broken in v2.23.0 (`/dev/fd/<n>: no such file or directory`), [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/255).
* The default config [no longer skips `git-lfs` downloads](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/256).
* Starting with cURL v7.66.0, [`$HOME/.netrc` can be used](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f9c7ba9096ec29db2536481d8e9ebe314e007f0c) instead of `$HOME/_netrc` (but it will still fall back to looking for the latter).
* The installer's "ProductVersion" [is now consistent with older Git for Windows versions'](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/257).
* [Makes `git config --system` work like you think it should](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2358).
* The (still experimental) built-in `git add -p` [no longer gets confused about incomplete lines](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2368) (i.e. a file's l last line that does not end in a Line Feed).

* The Git for Windows installer [no longer complains about a downgrade](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/264) when upgrading from an `-rc` version, i.e. from a pre-release leading up to the next major version.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.22.0 (June 8th 2019)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.23.0](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.23.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.23.0.txt).

### Bug Fixes

* Git for Windows' MSYS2 runtime was [patched](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/c10b4185a35f494a2ff4ad2f5828540d93d56bec) to fix a bug where setting the environment variable `SHELL` to an empty string in a shell script would not only fail to pass that setting to non-MSYS2 processes (such as `git.exe`) but also completely skip all environment variables that sort after said variable.
* `git clean -dfx` [no longer follows NTFS junction points (also known as mount points)](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2268).
* A [workaround](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2253) now allows cloning to certain network drives (e.g. Isilon).
* Fixed [CVE-2019-1211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1211) in MinGit/Portable Git by being more careful about validating the Windows-wide config.

* PortableGit [now comes with a meta credential helper](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2116), i.e. a GUI that lets the user choose *which* of the available credential helpers to use. This should help to avoid storing credentials on other people's machines when running portable Git from a thumb drive.

### Bug Fixes

* Git for Windows' updater [is now accessible](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/234), i.e. it can be read by a screen reader.
* `git update-git-for-windows` (i.e. the auto updater of Git for Windows) now [reports correctly when it failed to access the GitHub API](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/239).
* Git for Windows' updater [no longer runs into GitHub API rate limits](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/242) (this used to be quite common in enterprise scenarios, where many users would share one IP as far as GitHub is concerned).
* gitk [no longer fails with "filename too long"](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2170) when there are 1,000+ branches/tags.
* A bug which on occasion caused lengthy rebase runs to crash without error message [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2182).

* During a run of `git rebase --rebase-merges`, the output of `git status` [now shows `label` lines correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2185), i.e. with the labels' names instead of the commit hash they point to.
* We [now avoid problems updating the commit graph](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/2198) when `gc.writeCommitGraph=true`.

Please note that Git for Windows v2.19.2 was offered as a full release only for about a week, and then demoted to "pre-release" status, as it had two rather big regressions: 32-bit Git Bash crashed, and git:// was broken.

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.20.0](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.20.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.20.0.txt).

* Comes with [Git Credential Manager v1.18.3](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/tag/1.18.3).
* Comes with [Git LFS v2.6.0](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v2.6.0).

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with recursive clone ([CVE 2018-11235](https://aka.ms/cve-2018-11235)).
* Aliases that expand to shell commands [can now take arguments containing curly brackets](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/1637).
* Ctrl+C is now handled in Git Bash [in a sophisticated way](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/78e2deea8ec1db4aea1e78432ae98dac7198f6a5): it emulates the way Ctrl+C is handled in Git CMD, but in a fine-grained way.
* Based on the [the new Ctrl+C handling in Git Bash](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/78e2deea8ec1db4aea1e78432ae98dac7198f6a5), pressing Ctrl+C while `git log` is running will only stop Git from traversing the commit history, [but keep the pager running](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/df8884cbc5c39073848ddf2058bafeea1188312b).

* The option to disable revocation checks with Secure Channel which was introduced in v2.16.1(2) [now really works](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1531).
* Git [no longer enters an infinite loop](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1496) when misspelling `git status` as, say, `git Status`.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.3 (March 23rd 2018)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.16.3](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.16.3/Documentation/RelNotes/2.16.3.txt).
* When choosing to "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" (i.e. add only the minimal set of Git executables to the `PATH`), and when choosing the Git LFS component, Git LFS [is now included in that minimal set](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1503). This makes it possible to reuse Git for Windows' Git LFS, say, from Visual Studio.
* Comes with [gawk v4.2.1](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gawk.git/plain/NEWS?h=gawk-4.2.1).
* In conjunction with the FSCache feature, `git checkout` [is now a lot faster when checking out a *lot* of files](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/1468).
* Comes with [Git LFS v2.4.0](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v2.4.0).
* Comes with [Git Credential Manager v1.15.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/tag/v1.15.0).

* The Git for Windows SDK [can now be "installed" via `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/git-for-windows/git-sdk-64`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1357).
* The `tar` utility (included as a courtesy, not because Git needs it) [can now unpack `.tar.xz` archives](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/177).

### Bug Fixes

* When a `TERM` is configured that Git for Windows does not know about, [Bash no longer crashes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1473).
* The regression where `gawk` stopped treating Carriage Returns as part of the line endings [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1524).
* When Git asks for credentials via the terminal in a Powershell window, [it no longer fails to do so](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/1514).
* The installer [is now more robust when encountering files that are in use](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/commit/d33ee8606bfbc0e9b801df0a5257721e20f8dd4a) (and can therefore not be overwritten right away).
* The included `find` and `rm` utilities [no longer have problems with deeply nested directories on FAT drives](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1497).
* The `cygpath` utility included in Git for Windows now strips trailing slashes when normalizing paths (just like the Cygwin version of the utility; this is *different* from how MSYS2 chooses to do things).
* The certificates of HTTPS proxies configured via `http.proxy` [are now validated against the `ca-bundle.crt` correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1493).

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.1(4) (February 7th 2018)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.16.2](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.16.2/Documentation/RelNotes/2.16.2.txt).

* Comes with MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on [Cygwin 2.10.0](https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2018-02/msg00002.html); This required rebuilding OpenSSH, Perl (and some Perl modules) and Subversion.
* Comes with [Bash v4.4 patchlevel 019 ](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/NEWS).

### Bug Fixes

* The Perl upgrade in Git for Windows v2.16.1(4) [broke interactive authentication of `git svn`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1488), which was fixed.
* When configuring HTTPS transport to use Secure Channel, [we now refrain from configuring `http.sslCAInfo`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/172). This also helps Git LFS (which uses Git for Windows' private `http.sslCAInfo` setting) to use the same credentials as `git fetch` and `git push`.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.1(3) (February 6th 2018)

### Bug Fixes

* When called from TortoiseGit, `git.exe` [can now spawn processes again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1481).

* Comes with [perl-Net-SSLeay v1.84](https://metacpan.org/source/MIKEM/Net-SSLeay-1.84/Changes).

### Bug Fixes

* When `http.sslBackend` is not configured (e.g. in portable Git or MinGit), fetch/push operations [no longer crash](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1474).
* On Windows 7 and older, Git for Windows v2.16.1(2) was no longer able to spawn any processes (e.g. during fetch/clone). This regression [has been fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1475).
* The Perl upgrade in v2.16.1(2) broke `git send-email`; This [has been fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1480) by updating the Net-SSLeay Perl module.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.1 (January 22nd 2018)

### New Features

* Comes with [BusyBox v1.28.0pre.16550.0b3cdd76c](https://github.com/git-for-windows/busybox-w32/commit/0b3cdd76c).

### Bug Fixes

* When Git spawns processes, [now only the necessary file handles are inherited from the parent process](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/576ff26eeca22526b7ba11444da24d31daf0b369), possibly preventing file locking issues.
* The `git update` command [has been renamed to `git update-git-for-windows`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/167) to avoid confusion where users may think that `git update` updates their local repository or worktree.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.16.0(2) (January 18th 2018)

This is a hotfix release, based on upstream Git's hotfix to address a possible segmentation fault associated with case-insensitive file systems.

## Changes since Git for Windows v2.14.1 (August 10th 2017)

### New Features

* Comes with [Git v2.14.2](https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.14.2/Documentation/RelNotes/2.14.2.txt).
* Comes with [cURL v7.55.1](https://curl.haxx.se/changes.html#7_55_1).
* The XP-compatibility layer emulating pthreads (which is [no longer needed](https://git-for-windows.github.io/requirements.html)) [was dropped in favor of modern Windows threading APIs](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/1214); This should make threaded operations slightly faster and more robust.
* On Windows, UNC paths can [now be accessed via `file://host/share/repo.git`-style paths](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/a352941117bc8d00dfddd7a594adf095d084d844).
* Comes with [a new custom Git command `git update`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/151) to help keeping Git up-to-date on your machine.
* The Git installer now offers [an option to keep Git up-to-date](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/155) by calling `git update` regularly.
* Comes with [BusyBox v1.28.0pre.16353.2739df917](https://github.com/git-for-windows/busybox-w32/commit/2739df917).
* As is common elsewhere, Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right [now move word-wise in Git Bash](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/156), too.
* Comes with [patch level 2](https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/874e2c8efeed9084cd065cf9ea5c0951f5afca02) of the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on [Cygwin 2.9.0](https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2017-09/msg00056.html).
* Comes with [Git LFS v2.3.0](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v2.3.0).
* The `vs/master` branch [can now be built in Visual Studio 2017](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/1302), too
* As [requested](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1294) by the same user who implemented [the change](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/157), Git for Windows now comes with [`tig`](https://github.com/jonas/tig), a text-mode interface for Git.

### Bug Fixes

* It is [now possible to override `http.sslBackend` on the command-line](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/70c1ff8b0ef66321d630fe49d61ee1a9b6be6a4c).
* The installer [now detects correctly whether symbolic links can be created by regular users](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/commit/5e438f707027eb99da1b1b381672e6d7dbc063a8).
* Git Bash [now renders non-ASCII directories nicely](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/152).
* A regression that caused the fetch operation with lots of refs to be a lot slower than before [was fixed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1233).
* The `git-gui.exe` and `gitk.exe` wrappers intended to be used in Git CMD [now handle command-line parameters correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1284).
* The `core.longPaths` setting [is now heeded when packing refs](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1218), and other previously forgotten Git commands.
* Pressing Ctrl+Z in Git Bash [no longer kills Win32 processes (e.g. `git.exe`) anymore](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1083), because POSIX job control is only available with MSYS2 processes.
* Git for Windows [now sets `core.fsyncObjectFiles = true` by default](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/b5915c6ae881518927b9fa0b3c4df4d3edd37f23) which makes it a lot more fault-tolerant, say, when power is lost.
* A bug has been fixed where Git for Windows [could run into an infinite loop trying to rename a file](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/1299).
* Before installing Git for Windows, we already verified that no Git Bash instance is active (which would prevent files from being overwritten). We [now also verify that no `git.exe` processes are active, either](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/commit/1b93b50cf08c6cbd3200a66603d28fbd269c2f6a).

* The experimental option [`--show-ignored-directory` was added to `git status`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/1243) to show only the name of ignored directories when the option `--untracked=all` is used.
* Git for Windows releases now also include an experimental [BusyBox-based MinGit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/MinGit#experimental-busybox-based-mingit).

### Bug Fixes

* Repository-local aliases [are now resolved again in worktrees](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/6ba04141d88).

* Comes with Git v2.6.2
* Users who are part of a Windows domain [now have sensible default values](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/487) for `user.name` and `user.email`.

### Bug Fixes

* We [no longer run out of page file space](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/486) when `git fetch`ing large repositories.
* The description of Windows' default console is accurate now (the console became more powerful in Windows 10).
* *Git GUI* now respects the [terminal emulation chosen at install time](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/490) when [running the *Git Bash*](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/492).

## Changes since Git-2.6.0 (September 29th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.6.1
* The installer [now writes the file `/etc/install-options.txt`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/454) to record which options were chosen at install time.
* Replaces `git flow` with [the *AVH edition*](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) which is maintained actively, in surprising and disappointing contrast to Vincent Driessen's very own project.

### Bug Fixes

* The `PATH` variable [is now really left alone](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/438) when choosing the *"Use Git from Git Bash only"* option in the installer. Note that upgrading Git for Windows will call the previous version's uninstaller, which might still have that bug.
* Git GUI's *Registry>Create Desktop Icon* [now generates correct shortcuts](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/448).
* The `antiword` utility to render Word documents for use in `git diff` [now works correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/453).
* In 64-bit installations, we [no longer set a pack size limit by default](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/288).
* When installing Git for Windows as regular user, [the installer no longer tries to create privileged registry keys](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/455).

## Changes since Git-2.5.3 (September 18th 2015)

### New Features

* The `WhoUses.exe` tool to determine which process holds a lock on a given file (which was shipped with Git for Windows 1.x) [gets installed alongside Git for Windows again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/408).
* The values `CurrentVersion`, `InstallPath` and `LibexecPath` are [added to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\GitForWindows` registry key](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/427) to help third-party add-ons to find us.
* When fetching or pushing with Git *without* a console, we now [fall back to Git GUI's `askpass` helper](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/428) to ask for pass phrases.
* When run through `<INSTALL_PATH>\cmd\git.exe`, Git [will find tools in `$HOME/bin`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/429) now.

### Bug Fixes

* The portable version avoids DLL search path problems [even when installed into a FAT filesystem](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/390).
* Configuring `notepad` as editor without configuring a width for commit messages [no longer triggers an error message](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/430).
* When using Windows' default console for *Git Bash*, [the `.sh` file associations work again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/396).
* Portable Git's `README` [is now clearer about the need to run `post-install.bat` when unpacking manually](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/83).
* [We use the `winpty` trick now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/436) to run `ipython` interactively, too.
* When the environment variable `HOME` is not set, we [now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/414) fall back [correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/434) to use `HOMEDRIVE` and `HOMEPATH`.
* The home directory is now [set correctly](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/435) when running as the `SYSTEM` user.
* The environment variable `GIT_WORK_TREE` [may now differ in lower/upper case with the Git's idea of the current working directory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/402).
* Running `git clone --dissociate ...` [no longer locks the pack files during the repacking phase](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/446).
* Upstream cURL fixes for NTLM proxy issues ("Unknown SSL error") [were backported](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/373).
* The 64-bit version [now includes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/449) the `astextplain` script it lacked by mistake.

## Changes since Git-2.5.2(2) (September 13th 2015)

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.5.3.
* Includes [`git flow`](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
* By configuring `git config core.editor notepad`, users [can now use `notepad.exe` as their default editor](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/381). Configuring `git config format.commitMessageColumns 72` will be picked up by the notepad wrapper and line-wrap the commit message after the user edited it.
* The Subversion bindings for use with `git svn` [were upgraded to version 1.9.1](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/374).
* Some interactive console programs, e.g. `psql.exe`, [now work in mintty thanks to pre-configured aliases](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/399).
* The mechanism to diff `.pdf`, `.doc` and `.docx` files known from Git for Windows 1.x [has been ported to Git for Windows 2.x](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/355).
* Git can now [access IPv6-only hosts via HTTP/HTTPS](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/370).

### Bug Fixes

* The `.vimrc` in the home directory [is now allowed to have DOS line endings](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/364).
* The `README.portable` file of the portable Git [mentions the need to run `post-install.bat`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/394) when the archive was extracted manually.
* Home directories for user names [with non-ASCII characters](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/331) are [handled](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/336) correctly [now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/383).
* The documentation [no longer shows plain-text `linkgit:...` "links"](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/404) but proper hyperlinks instead.
* The `mtab` link [is written to `/etc/mtab` again, as it should](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/405).
* When run inside the PowerShell, Git no longer gets confused when the current directory's path and what is recorded in the file system differs in case (e.g. "GIT/" vs "Git/").

## Changes since Git-2.5.2 (September 10th 2015)

### Bug Fixes

### New Features

* Comes with Git 2.5.2
* Alternates [can now point to UNC paths](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/286), i.e. network drives.

### Bug Fixes

* The MSYS2 runtime was taught [not to look hard for groups](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/193), speeding up *Git Bash*'s startup time.
* A [work around](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/361) was added for [issues](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/32-bit-issues) when installing 32-bit Git for Windows on 64-bit Windows 10.
* The installer [no longer freezes](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/351) when there are interactive commands in the user's `.profile`.
* `git rebase --skip` [was speeded up again](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/365).
* The redirector in `/bin/bash.exe` now adjusts the `PATH` environment variable correctly (i.e. so that Git's executables are found) before launching the *real* Bash, even when called without `--login`.

* It is now possible [even behind NTLM-authenticated proxies](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/309) to install [Git for Windows' SDK](https://git-for-windows.github.io/#download-sdk).
* We [can handle the situation now](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/318) when the first `$PATH` elements point outside of Git for Windows' `bin/` directories and contain `.dll` files that interfere with our own (e.g. PostgreSQL's `libintl-8.dll`).

* `git gui` can Explore Working Copy on Windows again (thanks Markus Heidelberg).

* Ctrl+W will close `gitk` (thanks Jens Lehmann).
* `git gui` no longer binds Ctrl+C, which caused problems when trying to use said shortcut for the clipboard operation "Copy" (fixes issue 423, thanks Pat Thoyts).
* `gitk` does not give up when the command line length limit is reached (issue 387).
* The exit code is fixed when `Git.cmd` is called from `cmd.exe` (thanks Alexey Borzenkov).
* When launched via the (non-Cheetah) shell extension, the window icon is now correct (thanks Sebastian Schuberth).

## Changes since Git-1.6.4-preview20090729

* Thanks to Johan 't Hart, files and directories starting with a single dot (such as `.git`) will now be marked hidden (you can disable this setting with core.hideDotFiles=false in your config) (Issue 288).
* Thanks to Thorvald Natvig, Git on Windows can simulate symbolic links by using reparse points when available.  For technical reasons, this only works for symbolic links pointing to files, not directories.
* A lot of work has been put into making it possible to compile Git's source code (the part written in C, of course, not the scripts) with Microsoft Visual Studio.  This work is ongoing.
* Thanks to Sebastian Schuberth, we only offer the (Tortoise)Plink option in the installer if the presence of Plink was detected and at least one Putty session was found..
* Thanks to Sebastian Schuberth, the installer has a nicer icon now.
* Some more work by Sebastian Schuberth was done on better integration of Plink (Issues 305 & 319).

### Bugfixes
* Thanks to Sebastian Schuberth, `git svn` picks up the SSH setting specified with the installer (Issue 305).

## Changes since Git-1.6.3.2-preview20090608

## Changes since Git-1.6.3-preview20090507

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.6.3.2.
* Uses TortoisePlink instead of Plink if available.

### Bugfixes
* Plink errors out rather than hanging when the user needs to accept a host key first (Issue 96).
* The user home directory is inferred from `$HOMEDRIVE\$HOMEPATH` instead of `$HOME` (Issue 108).
* The environment setting `$CYGWIN=tty` is ignored (Issues 138, 248 and 251).
* The `ls` command shows non-ASCII filenames correctly now (Issue 188).
* Adds more syntax files for vi (Issue 250).
* `$HOME/.bashrc` is included last from `/etc/profile`, allowing `.bashrc` to override all settings in `/etc/profile` (Issue 255).
* Completion is case-insensitive again (Issue 256).
* The `start` command can handle arguments with spaces now (Issue 258).
* For some Git commands (such as `git commit`), `vi` no longer "restores" the cursor position.

## Changes since Git-1.6.2.2-preview20090408

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.6.3.
* Thanks to Marius Storm-Olsen, Git has a substantially faster `readdir()` implementation now.
* Marius Storm-Olsen also contributed a patch to include `nedmalloc`, again speeding up Git noticably.
* Compiled with GCC 4.4.0

### Bugfixes
* Portable Git contains a `README.portable`.
* Portable Git now actually includes the builtins.
* Portable Git includes `git-cmd.bat` and `git-bash.bat`.
* Portable Git is now shipped as a `.7z`; it still is a self-extracting archive if you rename it to `.exe`.
* Git includes the Perl Encode module now.
* Git now includes the `filter-branch` tool.
* There is a workaround for a Windows 7 regression triggering a crash in the progress reporting (e.g. during a clone). This fixes issues 236 and 247.
* `gitk` tries not to crash when it is closed while reading references (Issue 125, thanks Pat Thoyts).
* In some setups, hard-linking is not as reliable as it should be, so we have a workaround which avoids hard links in some situations (Issues 222 and 229).
* `git-svn` sets `core.autocrlf` to `false` now, hopefully shutting up most of the `git-svn` reports.

## Changes since Git-1.6.2.1-preview20090322

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.6.2.2.
* Upgraded Tcl/Tk to 8.5.5.
* TortoiseMerge is supported by mergetool now.
* Uses pthreads (faster garbage collection on multi-core machines).
* The test suite passes!

### Bugfixes
* Renaming was made more robust (due to Explorer or some virus scanners, files could not be renamed at the first try, so we have to try multiple times).
* Johannes Sixt made lots of changes to the test-suite to identify properly which tests should pass, and which ones cannot pass due to limitations of the platform.
* Support `PAGER`s with spaces in their filename.
* Quite a few changes were undone which we needed in the olden days of msysGit.
* Fall back to `/` when HOME cannot be set to the real home directory due to locale issues (works around Issue 108 for the moment).

## Changes since Git-1.6.2-preview20090308

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.6.2.1.
* A portable application is shipped in addition to the installer (Issue 195).

* Temporary files are created respecting `core.autocrlf` (Issue 177).
* The Git Bash prompt is colorful again (Issue 199).
* Fixed crash when hardlinking during a clone failed (Issue 204).
* An infinite loop was fixed in `git-gui` (Issue 205).
* The ssh protocol is always used with `plink.exe` (Issue 209).
* More vim files are shipped now, so that syntax highlighting works.

## Changes since Git-1.5.5-preview20080413

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.5.6.
* Installer supports configuring a user provided Plink (PuTTY).

### Bugfixes

* cmd wrapper does no longer close the command window.
* Programs in the system `PATH`, for example editors, can be launched from Git without specifying their full path.
* `git stash apply stash@{1}` works.
* Comes with basic ANSI control code emulation for the Windows console to avoid wrapping of pull/merge's diffstats.
* Git correctly passes port numbers to PuTTY's Plink

## Changes since Git-1.5.4-preview20080202

### New Features
* Comes with official git 1.5.5.
* `core.autocrlf` is enabled (`true`) by default. This means git converts to Windows line endings (CRLF) during checkout and converts to Unix line endings (LF) during commit. This is the right choice for cross-platform projects. If the conversion is not reversible, git warns the user. The installer warns about the new default before the installation starts.
* The user does no longer have to "accept" the GPL but only needs to press "continue".
* Installer deletes shell scripts that have been replaced by builtins. Upgrading should be safer.
* Supports `git svn`. Note that the performance might be below your expectation.

### Bugfixes
* Newer ssh fixes connection failures (issue 74).
* Comes with MSys-1.0.11-20071204.  This should solve some "fork: resource unavailable" issues.
* All DLLs are rebased to avoid problems with "fork" on Vista.

* Release notes are displayed in separate window.
* Includes `qsort` replacement to improve performance on Windows 2000.

### Bugfixes
* Fixes invalid error message that setup.ini cannot be deleted on uninstall.
* Setup tries harder to finish the installation and reports more detailed errors.
* Vim's syntax highlighting is suitable for dark background.

## Changes since Git-1.5.3.5-preview20071114

### New Features
* Git is included in version 1.5.3.6.
* Setup displays release notes.

### Bugfixes
* `pull`/`fetch`/`push` in `git-gui` works. Note, there is no way for `ssh` to ask for a passphrase or for confirmation if you connect to an unknown host. So, you must have ssh set up to work without passphrase. Either you have a key without passphrase, or you started ssh-agent. You may also consider using PuTTY by pointing `GIT_SSH` to `plink.exe` and handle your ssh keys with Pageant. In this case you should include your login name in urls. You must also connect to an unknown host once from the command line and confirm the host key, before you can use it from `git-gui`.

## Changes since Git-1.5.3-preview20071027

### New Features
* Git is included in version 1.5.3.5.
